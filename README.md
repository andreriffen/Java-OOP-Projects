# Object-Oriented Programming Project with Java 📖

 Greetings [@everyone](#object-oriented-programming-project-with-java-)🖖, welcome to 1998 ☕️💻.

Ah, Java... the language that makes us question our career choices every single day. This repository is like a guided tour into the underworld of programming, where every line of code written is a scream of despair into the void.

Have you ever wondered how a language can be so verbose that even a `Hello World` seems like a philosophical discussion? Well, you've come to the right place to find out.

    "Learning Java is like riding a bike, but the wheels are square, there are no handlebars, and the bike is on fire."

## Write once, debug everywhere 🤡

**Infinite Verbosity:** Why write one line when you can write a hundred? Java loves turning even the simplest task into an epic saga worthy of Tolkien.

**Memory Management:** "Garbage Collector" sounds like a punk rock band, but it's actually just Java trying to get rid of the garbage it creates itself. 🗑️

**Constant Updates:** Just updated to the latest version of Java? Great! Now, get ready to update again in five minutes. 💥

**Miserable Performance:** It's like running through a mud field while carrying an elephant on your back. Java makes even the simplest task feel like an obstacle course.

**Horrendous User Interfaces:** Swing, JavaFX... who needs a beautiful and functional interface when you can have a user experience that looks like it came straight out of 1998?

**Unruly Exception Handling:** "Create an exception for every possible situation," they said. "It'll be fun," they said. Spoiler: it's not.

⚠️ This repository is a dark journey into the darkest corners of Java programming. **New developers:** be ready to laugh (or cry) as we explore the abyss of verbosity, complexity, and frustration that is programming in Java.

I hope my OOP teacher doesn't read this. And if he does, I hope he had a good laugh about it.

Wow! You're still here? That's amazing, you really like *README* files, don't you? Well, since we've come this far, grab a coffee and sit down for a chat, my young padawan-grasshopper, let me tell you some truths. 🍷🗿

## Reasons not to choose Java in 2024 (never, ever, under any circumstances, in any scenario)

In PHP, it's like smoothly gliding down a refreshing water slide 🌈, while in Java, it's like trying to navigate through a dense, thorny forest wearing nothing but swim trunks.

### Here are some reasons why PHP might be a smarter and more enjoyable choice for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) compared to Java.

**Unbearable Verbosity:** In Java, you're forced to type out code so verbose that even a simple operation feels like a typing marathon. Meanwhile, in PHP, you can express your ideas quickly and concisely, without drowning in endless lines of code.

**Excessive Complexity:** Java is like a complicated, confusing puzzle where each piece is hidden under layers of abstraction. PHP, on the other hand, is like a set of simple, intuitive building blocks that fit together seamlessly, making it easier to understand and solve problems.

**Rigidity and Lack of Flexibility:** In Java, you're forced to follow strict, rigid rules like an inflexible dictator. PHP, on the other hand, allows you to be the master of your own destiny, offering flexibility and freedom to experiment and innovate.

**Cost and Overhead:** Setting up and maintaining a Java development environment can be like a stab in the wallet, with additional costs for software licenses and robust hardware. Meanwhile, PHP is open-source and free, making it accessible to everyone regardless of pocket size.

*Overall, while Java may be a viable choice for some projects, PHP shines as a simpler, more agile, and accessible alternative for those looking to learn OOP concepts without the unnecessary weight and complexity.*

Do you agree?

Oh, I almost forgot: Check out my [oop-php repository](https://github.com/andreriffen/PHP-OOP-Projects)! I did some very similar applications using the same concepts in PHP.
